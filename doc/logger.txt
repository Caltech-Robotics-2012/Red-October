General Idea of the Red-October Logging System

The logger program currently defines a Log class.
If included in another program, instances of the Log 
   class can be created, and the write_msg() method
   can be used to write to the log file.

A class is used because this gives us flexibility in 
  determining how many log files (e.g. all, error, sensors)
  we want to create. 


Usage:

Create a log as new Log(std::string(log's name here)).
This will create a current log file with the name "name1.log".
If log(s) already exist, they will be pushed back to the
   preset limit (a constant integer, NUM_LOGS) found in the
   header file.

The log can be written to using logname.write_msg(std::string("message"))
