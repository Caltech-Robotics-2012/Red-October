General Idea of the Red-October Logging System

The logger program currently defines a Log class.
If included in another program, instances of the Log 
class can be created, and the write_msg() method
can be used to write to the log file.

A class is used because this gives us flexibility in 
determining how many log files (e.g. all, error, sensors)
we want to create.
